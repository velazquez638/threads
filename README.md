Firstly the programe show a short menu. The options of this menu are titles which are in a containers. 

Through the interface i define the void which show the menu lines. When i have defined the interface i have created three classes whith 

the menu options. After that i only need to call the container in the main menu with the parameters that i have created.



'''


public class Contenedor {

	private Interfaz interfaz;
	 
	public Contenedor(Interfaz interfaz){
	 
	this.interfaz=interfaz;
	 
	}
	 
	public void mensaje(){
	 
		interfaz.mensaje();
	 
	}
